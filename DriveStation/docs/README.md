This is intended to become an equivalent to the FRC Driver Station that is compatible with Linux and Mac Operating Systems.

The current Drive Station only works with Windows, which is not very good.

This does not work yet; it is still just a skeleton. Email cameronh344728@gmail.com if you are interested in collaborating on this project.
